      "Narrow in places and twisty througout, this leg churner is sure to keep you on you toes. Sight lines are fantastic and the flow is amazing. Watch that you don't overshoot the switchback to stay on the black diamond descent - the blue route is completely overgrown. This created a reroute of the single track. Perfect flow day with hard moist dirt with only 1/2 bird baths along the way!",

      "The exposed rock section near the bottom is a highlight of the trail giving the exposed granite slabs of Squamish a run for their money. Logs embedded in the trail have been installed to signal technical terrain. You now have to ride down an asphalt trail and cut off onto a gravel trail before getting back to the old single track. The upper half is more technical with lots of rocks and a step up onto a boulder. The area can be accessed from the end of Densmore's Lane, the end of Old Petty Harbour Road and from Huntingdale Drive.",

      "Ridgeline is a crown jewel of Dupont State Recreational Forest. I've master huck to flat though! Although it's not technical there are plenty of opportunities to slip in the loose rock and end up with some serious road rash, especially at the speeds you'll be going on the downhills! This trail can be ridden as a loop, or could be ridden as an out-in-back. It's mostly a hike-a-bike up and then has an advanced all-mountain feel coming down.",

      "Also you exit onto a trail where hikers frequent, so keep it under control here. A super fun freeride trail starting with the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect flow. Large group of trees down on northern section of trail, between buckhorn and club gap. Tree down near southern trail head. If you keep your momentum you can charge up pretty much all the climbs and the descents are steep and tricky.",
